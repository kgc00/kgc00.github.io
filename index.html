                    <h2>HALEF</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    During the summer of 2017, I worked on an iteration of the HALEF system for ETS, as part of a full-time internship in San Francisco, California.
                    I worked primarily alone but was supported during some parts of the learning process by other team members. <br />
                    <i>
                        You can read more about the process in this research paper we published
                        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3136755.3143034" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        <br />
                        You can read more about the experience in this interview with American University
                        <a href="https://www.american.edu/soc/news/kirby-cofino-ets-avatar-design.cfm" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    HALEF is a multi-modal dialogue system; put simply, it is a computer system with which users can interact through spoken dialogue.  Utilizing HALEF,
                    it is possible to have a unique conversation with a computer.
                    <br /><br />
                    Previous iterations of HALEF suffered from multiple issues, ranging from unacceptably long load times (10+ minutes);
                    audio and animations becoming out of sync; and poor lip animations.  When starting work on this system,
                    I was told that the priorities were to cut down on load times and keep the project open source (no proprietary software/techniques).
                    Due to the incredibly long load times, ETS was considering moving from Unity to other engines/javascript libraries (such as three.js)
                </p>

                <h3>Solution</h3>

                <h4>To reduce the file size:</h4>
                <p>
                    I had previously done research into mobile game applications and learned that web and mobile game development were very different from console or pc development.
                    Every asset was created with its file size in mind, to reduce load times, leading to low poly models, 2D art, and low-resolution textures.
                    With this in mind, I advocated for a low-poly 3D aesthetic, as 3D was central to the team’s future goals.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/HALEF_TexturePalette.png" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        My texture palette for the project, a whopping 5kb on disk.  A second palette was used for the
                        office itself, which was also ~5kb.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used Blender, an open source 3D modeling program, as well as open source libraries such as Socket.IO to keep the project 100% open source.
                    <br /><br />
                    Additionally, I researched ways to reduce Unity WebGL file size and possible alternative solutions to using Unity.
                    Luckily, I found that there was an upgrade to Unity’s WebGL functionality (the introduction of engine code stripping)
                    that helped immensely to reduce file size/load time.  With the addition of a low-poly workplace and avatar, which I built from scratch,
                    we were good to go.  I used Blender to model, texture, rig, and animate the avatar.
                </p>

                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/HALEF1.png" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        The low-poly feel, although unusual for a project of this nature, fit the goals and requirements very well.
                        Flat shading helped pull off the look and increase performance.
                    </i>
                </p>

                <h4>
                    To eliminate latency issues:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    For the animation and sound problems, I decided that the best way to eliminate a discrepancy between audio and video would be to
                    re-architect the way in which sound and animations were called.
                    <br /><br />
                    Rather than embedding the audio in the webpage and calling
                    for it using javascript, as the previous iteration had, I included the audio inside the Unity web blob.
                    Rather than animating the avatar on the update loop (via blendshape normalized values called by code), as the previous iteration had I controlled
                    animations by creating them in Blender and exporting them into Unity.  This allowed me to play an entire animation with a single message,
                    which was useful for keeping audio and video in sync.
                    <br /><br />
                    Mouths were animated using the Papagayo + JLipSync plugin
                    pipeline in Blender, which was a perfect solution for our needs.  It offered a robust way to account for new dialogue,
                    while also becoming more efficient the longer we used the same models.  This is because it works by setting up phoneme shapes,
                    such as 'o', or 'L', and interpolating values between those mouth shapes (rather than hand animating every mouth movement).
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/Papagayo_screen.png" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        Papagayo is used to insert keyframes for mouth movement via an intuitive GUI.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I fundamentally changed the way in which the HALEF system interacts with the Unity web blob (due to my flow re-architecture
                    and the Unity issued updated WebGL format)
                    I had to change how messages were passed to the different parts of the system.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/HALEF_Flow1.PNG" style="max-width:320px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        The Unity web blob lives inside the client's browser page via websocket messaging it interacts with the server,
                        which reads the scenario from a unique conversation file.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first added hooks in the Unity web blob which could be accessed via javascript
                    run on the HTML page, then I had the system pass a message to Unity depending on its status through the javascript running on the HTML page.
                </p>

                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/HALEF_Flow2.PNG" style="max-width:720px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        The system feedback loop is illustrated here.  HALEF (the system) outputs phrases to Unity to represent it's decisions to the user.
                        The user responded, which was carried back to HALEF via the freeswitch platform, etc.
                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    By doing so I could tell HALEF to pass a message to Unity,
                    which would fire both the necessary animation and play the necessary audio, eliminating any possibility for desynchronizing.
                </p>
                <h3>Tasks</h3>
                <p>
                    To get this project to work properly, I had to use WebSocket messaging, HTML, javascript,
                    and C# to trigger actions and responses.
                    Additionally, I had to use Blender to model, texture, rig, and animate the avatar; I was also responsible for creating mouth
                    and lip animations which synced to pre-existing audio.
                </p>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>
                    Doing the above, I developed a working, low load-time application, complete with a decent looking 3D model.  It was an incredible
                    experience to be able to immerse myself in that pipeline, which was almost entirely new to me, while thinking critically about how
                    each part affected the final product, and what I could do to eliminate the bugs in the previous iteration.  There was a lot of learning
                    on the job, but even so, I am proud that I was still able to deliver a product that both ETS and I approved.
                    <br /><br />
                    Because of my contributions, I was offered a contract position to work part-time with ETS while I finished my master’s degree in Game Design at American University.  The
                    contract was twice extended, and eventually turned into a full-time position during the summer of 2018.  I am currently working in ETS's San Francisco office.
                    I am currently working on the next iteration of HALEF as I pursue my degree (shown here):

                        The current iteration of HALEF depicted, I am still continuing work on improving the system and the pipeline.  We

                    <h2>4 Floors</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>
                    4 Floors was conceived as a way to adapt a side-scroller with RPG elements to a tabletop format.  Some core goals of the game
                    were accessibility to non-gamers and cooperative multiplayer gameplay.
                    <br /><br />
                    4 Floors was developed in 3 weeks in 2016 with a team of 2 people:
                    myself on systems design and my teammate on art and graphic design.
                </p>
                <h3>Execution</h3>
                <p>
                    Because I was designing for tabletop, simplicity was a core guiding principle.  The game had to be usable and the mechanics learnable.
                    Analogue games tend to be more successful with simpler and fewer rules (computers aren’t there to walk players through the game and
                    calculate all the different equations for them).  Additionally, this game was meant to be accessible to newer players or players who weren’t too
                    interested in heavy calculations and obscure rules.
                    <br /><br />
                    In light of this, I had only a few rules- players started the game on the left side of the board, and if they made it to the right side, then they won.  Simple, right?
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/Iteration1.jpeg" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        First iteration of 4 Floors.  The board setup afforded some fantastic design opportunities, but also created problems.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Players would take on 2 columns of enemies at a time.  Ranged units from the players’ party or the monsters’ party could attack from the 2nd column,
                    but melee units could only hit the column directly in front of them.  By using skills smartly it was possible to damage groups that you couldn't reach

                <h3>Dilemma</h3>
                <p>
                    Feedback indicated that our system for randomly generating columns (through dice rolls) was imbalanced, leading to unnecessarily difficult situations.
                    For example, it was very difficult to deal with a column of 5 units in front of a column of 5 ranged units.
                    <br /><br />
                    Another core piece of feedback was that there was not much variation in combat.  There were 2, perhaps 3, types of enemies which acted similarly.
                    People were interested in an expanded bestiary.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <h4>Enemy Group Size</h4>
                <p>
                    To deal with these issues, I decided to expand upon the narrative of the game and introduce new enemies.  I had been inspired by ‘A Pattern Language’
                    by Christopher Alexander, a book about how architecture and intentional design can affect our everyday lives for the better, which got me thinking about
                    how spaces in games can affect gameplay.  In this case, it led me to introduce a room based combat system.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/RoomExamples.jpg" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        Players now draw a random 'room' card from the 'room' deck.  This will tell players how many monsters will be in the room, as well as any additional effects
                        or bonuses the room provides.
                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Room-based exploration was important in a few ways, the first being that a room’s size will limit the number of creatures contained within it.  Instead of
                    every encounter having the possibility of a brutal number of enemies, staging these encounters inside a limited space allowed me to dictate what range of
                    enemies players would face at a time.  This was important for normalizing difficulty across all encounters.  Finally, this change also was helpful
                    for learnability and usability of the system-- players could see only what they could interact with at that moment.
                </p>
                <p align="center">

                        Using rooms helped to teach the game to players, as well as clearly define the difficulty curve of the game.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <h4>Combat Additions</h4>
                <p>
                    Players wanted different kinds of enemies, which required different approaches to combat for success.  To address this pleasure point I decided to include
                    a more robust progression system, to give players more tools to work with, as well as an increased variety in enemies, to facilitate the use of these tools.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/EnemyTypes.jpg" style="max-width:480px"> <br />

                        New, varied enemy types.  Some deal damage per turn, some require being taken out from full HP in a single turn or they heal, etc.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    New types of enemies were introduced which required different methods to overcome.  This was tied into difficulty and progression through use of a 'floor' system.
                    Players would clear a certain number of rooms per floor, fight a boss, then advance to the next floor.  Later floors were more difficult and rewarding, allowing for
                    me to design obstacles for different stages of character progression.  For simplicity, I designed all special monster abilities to activate on rolls of 5 or 6.
                    Sharing this across all enemy types help learnability and ease of use.
                </p>
                <h4>Player Progression</h4>
                <p>
                    To deal with more powerful enemies and increase player engagement I updated character design with unique abilities and mechanics per class.
                    Every player would have 'skill cards' which allowed single use, powerful abilities to be activated.  Depending on which skill card was drawn
                    players would have access to different abilities.  This was done to limit player options and to encourage spontaneous and explorative play.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/projects/PlayerExample.jpg" style="max-width:480px"> <br />

                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, I included items which helped to customize characters and shore up weaknesses or emphasize strengths differently in each playthrough.
                    Players would draw a random item from the item deck if certain conditions were met, such as defeating a boss.  Players could trade items
                    to support cooperative play.
                </p>
                <p align="center">

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    By adding more content and refining existing mechanics, I shaped player options and increased both the depth and amount of options available to players.
                    <br /><br />
                    Personally, I feel the game successfully conveyed an interesting take on a cooperative side-scroller experience while also containing dungeon crawling
                    and RPG elements.  I would love to revisit the horizontal nature of initial iteration at some point, however, I feel that there were many problems, such as
                    learnability and clarity, that were improved with the move towards a room based system.  It was definitely fun to design a dungeon crawling tabletop RPG.

                    <h2>Strife!</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Strife! Was my capstone project for my MA in Game Design at American University.
                    We had 3 and a half months to create a project from scratch, team size was a single person.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I’d been playing a lot of card games like Hearthstone and The Elder Scrolls: Legends at that point in my life, so I decided to create a CCG-like game, however,
                    I didn’t think the world needed another Magic clone(!), so I purposefully made it mechanically distinct.
                    Strife! is at heart an experimental mix of a board game and a CCG.  I combined the Strategy game and Card Game genres to create something new and exciting.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration for Strife! came from the RTS and CCG genres.  To start, I decided to map out a list of elements in both of these genres,
                    then try to find commonalities.  From there I chose which of those elements were most important, and which were less so.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/strife/proto.jpeg" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        One early document, among many, to refine the design.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a core direction defined, I could start brainstorming ways to mechanically represent them.  I ended up focusing on a spatial element of multiple ‘zones’.
                    Additionally, I decided to reduce uncertainty by giving players the ability to always have access to any units they’ve unlocked, throughout the game.
                    This was meant to also act as an homage to the tech trees in strategy games.
                </p>

                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I created some units and abilities to populate the game and playtested.
                    After each playtest I would use notes to refine and adjust the balance of the game until it felt like a stable, dynamic, and exciting experience.

                        Getting to play with cards which had the stats and abilities printed on them was a milestone for me, and fantastic for people trying to pick up the game.

                </p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    To get a feel for the game, I’ll give an overview of the rules.  Each player can construct buildings, these buildings can spawn units.
                    Buildings and units need one turn to get ready before they can be used.  Units can use abilities, attack, and move.
                    Possible targets for offensive actions are other player’s buildings, units, and the other player themselves.
                    Destroying buildings is a way to damage your opponents economy.  There’s also a deck of powerful abilities which are obtained by producing structures.
                </p>

                        A sample building.  Front side is on the left, the back side is on the right.
                    </i>
                </p>

                <h3>Dilemmas</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout all phases of development, Strife! suffered from pacing issues.  Many of the earlier iterations’ games would last multiple hours with lulls
                    where players wouldn’t meaningfully interact with each other.  Finally, there were huge issues with the amount of complexity present in both the rules
                    of the game and the unit abilities.
                </p>

                <h3>Solutions for Pacing</h3>
                <p>
                    The mechanics of the game caused the slow pace of the game.  Although I did like the core ideas of representing space via multiple zones,
                    as well as a tech tree players could progress on, their implementation left the game feeling stale and unengaging.  There were a large number
                    of zones players had to progress through before they could either damage a player’s health or economy, additionally, because moving used up that
                    unit’s actions for the turn, the defending player would always have the choice of what to trade for what.  This made defensive play incredibly strong.
                </p>
                <p align="center">
                    <img class="image" src="images/strife/proto2.jpeg" style="max-width:480px"> <br />
                    <i>
                        An early playtest.  Playing with index cards and spreadsheets did not help games to move quickly.  Many times players would spend minutes consulting the
                        spreadsheet before taking their move.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through playtesting, I settled upon using three zones, rather than 4, 6, or 8.  Additionally, I allowed units to both use an ability and move to a different
                    zone each turn to allow for the aggressive player to choose what trades they’d like to take.  I also specified a cap of 6 units per zone, to stop players from
                    stockpiling units, creating an impenetrable wall of bodies.  Finally, I linked board options to economic strength by way of giving players a strong, randomized
                    ability with every building constructed.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of economics, originally the game had ways to invest into economy, by building structures which boost gold gain per turn.  I wanted to allow players
                    to play greedy and take risks for a greater payout later.  However, due to the defensive nature of the game, building these structures was always the correct move.
                    I eventually settled upon taking them out of the game, giving players a free structure each turn, and the ability to build a second one for gold.
                    This allowed players to invest in an immediate advantage, in the form of units on the board, or an economic advantage, in the form of buildings.

                <h3>Solutions for Complexity</h3>
                <p>
                    For most of playtesting, users playtested with torn up index cards and spreadsheets off to the side.  Many complained that it was hard to understand which units
                    could do what, and with tech trees being in the game, many didn’t know what units they were progressing towards.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    During the last two weeks of development, I spent my time looking at the pieces from a UX perspective.  I did interviews to figure out what kinds of things
                    people wanted on cards, problems they faced, what they liked about the game, etc.  Using this information I created multiple mock-ups, focusing on both which information
                    should be included on the pieces, as well as how it’s included.  I tested different icons, text, and shared terminology to help users onboard quickly.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned a great deal by developing Strife!.  First off, one of the ideas I wanted to play around with was to do what I could to remove randomness from the game.
                    Doing so, in the way that I did, actually made the game static and unengaging.  By allowing for players to always be able to do any action, it takes away the developer’s
                    ability to make the actions exciting and powerful.  The more situational and undependable a play is, the more liberty we have, as designers, to make it strong and exciting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many other lessons, but ultimately, this was the most important to me.  I feel like Strife! failed in many ways: I had to reintroduce chance, games take
                    too long, and it still feels similar to Magic, however, I also succeeded in making a unique, deep, and fun game.  Because of this, and what I’ve learned from the project,
                    I consider the game a success.

                    <p>
                        I'm a musician, artist, designer, and avid gamer.  I love creating new things and digging into juicy mechanics.
                        I’ve been playing games my whole life, and although designing is my forte, coding has come naturally to me.
                        I specialize in C#, and have experience with C++ and Javascript as well.
                        <br /> <br />
                        I've been involved with esports since 2006, and I feel that this experience has helped to shape my view of game design.
                        As a competitive player in titles like Street Fighter, Dota, and Starcraft, I can understand how, through my familiarity with their systems,
                        mechanics affect the balance of a game on a deep level.  I feel that my familiarity with the competitive scene across many different
                        titles has helped me to become a better designer.
                        <br /><br />
                        I was the deputy chair of the local IGDA chapter (DC) until I moved in the spring of 2018.  During my time in DC, I helped to run
                        local game events (SAAM Arcade, GGJ, P3M5 @ the Goethe Institute).
                        I'm currently working for Educational Testing Services in San Francisco. I recently graduated from American University with an MA in Game Design (2018).
                        My BA was obtained in Philosophy from SUNY Purchase in 2013.
                        <br /> <br />Cheers!
                    </p>
