                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the summer of 2018, I completed my second full-time internship with ETS out of their in San
                        Francisco office. I worked primarily alone but was supported during some parts of the learning process
                        by other team members.  This section details topics which builds off of work done during my first year's internship.
                        You can read more about these topics on the HALEF page <a href="#halef" class="jumplink">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        The team's goals had changed with the working prototype from last summer and my tasks for the summer would reflect that.
                        The new priorities were to support non-experts who wished to author new content for our system and further explorations
                        into increasing fidelity while lowering file size.
                    </p>                    
                    <h3>Authoring Content</h3>
                    <p>
                        Enabling non-experts to author content involved two kinds of animation pipelines, one for mouth animations and one for body animations.

                        I figured we could use a kinect to do low-cost and simple DIY motion recording for the body animations.  After experimentation,
                        I was able to record and re-target animations from the Kinect onto different kinds of avatars.  However, the complexity of the process,
                        the fidelity of the output, and the size of the animation files proved prohibitive for the goals of the project and it was decided to
                        continue with a traditional animation pipeline for the near future.  With this knowledge I could focus on other goals for the project.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Automating Mouth Animations</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the automated lip-syncing I set out to create a script which would not 100% accurately reflect 
                        the source material, but do a good enough job that it seemed believable.  I chose to create a Python script
                        which would take some kind of audio as input.
                        <!-- image -->
                        It would then cut that audio up into small segments and analyze the amplitude of that segment.
                        I then inserted a hook so that we could process that data in any way we need to, in this case normalizing
                        and adjusting the values such that there was a smooth transition from segment to segment.  
                        <!-- In the future this would be where developers could use other techniques to adjust the output for that sample. 
                        For example, if one were to use a spectrogram profile of the audio for that segment then it's possible to augment or diminish
                        the strength of the segment to match the shape a mouth would need to make to produce that sound.  For example, if we detect an "a" or "o",
                        increse the output of the sample, and an "m" or "p" profile means a decreased output. -->
                        After all the processing had finished, the script would then translate the values of the segments into a
                        a .txt file (and show them visually on a graph).  
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                            <img class="image general-image" src="images/projects/parsedLipValues.png" >
                            <p class="image-caption">
                                A graph showing the output of an audio file.
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        These values were on a normalized scale of 0-1 and would directly correlate 
                        to how "open" the avatar's mouth should be during that frame. For an animation of 200 frames, there would be 200 values in the document.
                        These values would then be imported into unity and read during run-time to produce realistic looking mouth animations.
                        The best part about this is that anyone who can drag, drop, and double click files can now implement mouth
                        animations for any avatar.  
                    </p>
                    <!-- <div class="image-wrapper">

                    </div> -->
                    <h3>3D Asset Creation</h3>
                    <p>
                        As part of the initiative to create more content I was tasked with creating an additional 3D avatar
                        for use in certain scenarios.  The avatar had the same restrictions as my previous work: it had 
                        to be of a low file size and web friendly.  It would likely be used alongside the previous model,
                        so I used similar techniques to author content which wouldn't look out of place in a stylized context. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img class="image general-image portrait" src="images/projects/alice.png" >
                        <p class="image-caption">
                            Alice will be used as an interactable avatar in a business setting.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Because my skills as a developer and artist had grown during the past year I experimented with different
                        techniques to see what gave the best results.  I ended up using a small texture (about 1 MB) and hand-painted
                        the texture onto the avatar to allow for gradients between shading values and a higher fidelity overall while still
                        maintaining a low file-size.  
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-wrapper">
                        <img class="image general-image" src="images/projects/alice_office.jpg" >
                        <p class="image-caption">
                            Alice in an office setting.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    I also experimented with using Unity driven coroutines and IK targets to minimize
                        animation file sizes for smaller gestures like raising arms or blinking.  Finally, I experimented 
                        with implementing scenes using Three.JS, hoping for smaller file sizes, better web compatibility,
                        and quicker loading times, but it didn't offer much advantage over Unity.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through an expertise in javascript and python I was able to create and implement tools which supported
                        project goals.  My experiences with 3D art allowed me to create a stylized avatar for use in future projects.
                        I was able to explore different environments and techniques including Three.JS, Unity, Motion Capture
                        via the Kinect, and automated lip-syncing via coding to help further research goals and produce deliverables.

                    dialogue. Utilizing HALEF, it is possible to have a unique conversation with a computer.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Previous iterations of HALEF suffered from multiple issues, ranging from unacceptably long load times
                    (10+ minutes); audio and animations becoming out of sync; and poor lip animations. When starting work
                    on this system, I was told that the priorities were to cut down on load times and keep the project open
                    source (no proprietary software/techniques). Due to the incredibly long load times, ETS was considering
                    moving from Unity to other engines/javascript libraries (such as three.js)

                <h3>Solution</h3>

                <h4>To reduce the file size:</h4>
                <p>
                    I had previously done research into mobile game applications and learned that web and mobile game development were very different
                    from console or pc development. Every asset was created with its file size in mind, to reduce load times,
                    leading to low poly models, 2D art, and low-resolution textures. With this in mind, I advocated for a
                    low-poly 3D aesthetic, as 3D was central to the team’s future goals.
                </p>

                    <p class="image-caption">
                        My texture palette for the project, a whopping 5kb on disk. A second palette was used for the office itself, which was also
                        ~5kb.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I used Blender, an open source 3D modeling program, as well as open source libraries such as Socket.IO to keep the project
                    100% open source.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Additionally, I researched ways to reduce Unity WebGL file size and possible alternative solutions to
                    using Unity. Luckily, I found that there was an upgrade to Unity’s WebGL functionality (the introduction
                    of engine code stripping) that helped immensely to reduce file size/load time. With the addition of a
                    low-poly workplace and avatar, which I built from scratch, we were good to go. I used Blender to model,
                    texture, rig, and animate the avatar.

                        The low-poly feel, although unusual for a project of this nature, fit the goals and requirements very well. Flat shading

                <h4>
                    To eliminate latency issues:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    For the animation and sound problems, I decided that the best way to eliminate a discrepancy between audio and video would
                    be to re-architect the way in which sound and animations were called.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Rather than embedding the audio in the webpage and calling for it using javascript, as the previous
                    iteration had, I included the audio inside the Unity web blob. Rather than animating the avatar on the
                    update loop (via blendshape normalized values called by code), as the previous iteration had I controlled
                    animations by creating them in Blender and exporting them into Unity. This allowed me to play an entire
                    animation with a single message, which was useful for keeping audio and video in sync.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Mouths were animated using the Papagayo + JLipSync plugin pipeline in Blender, which was a perfect solution
                    for our needs. It offered a robust way to account for new dialogue, while also becoming more efficient
                    the longer we used the same models. This is because it works by setting up phoneme shapes, such as 'o',
                    or 'L', and interpolating values between those mouth shapes (rather than hand animating every mouth movement).
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Because I fundamentally changed the way in which the HALEF system interacts with the Unity web blob (due to my flow re-architecture
                    and the Unity issued updated WebGL format) I had to change how messages were passed to the different
                    parts of the system.

                        The Unity web blob lives inside the client's browser page via websocket messaging it interacts with the server, which reads

                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I first added hooks in the Unity web blob which could be accessed via javascript run on the HTML page, then I had the system
                    pass a message to Unity depending on its status through the javascript running on the HTML page.
                </p>

                <div class="image-wrapper">

                        The system feedback loop is illustrated here. HALEF (the system) outputs phrases to Unity to represent it's decisions to
                        the user. The user responded, which was carried back to HALEF via the freeswitch platform, etc.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    By doing so I could tell HALEF to pass a message to Unity, which would fire both the necessary animation and play the necessary
                    audio, eliminating any possibility for desynchronizing.

                    Doing the above, I developed a working, low load-time application, complete with a decent looking 3D model. It was an incredible
                    experience to be able to immerse myself in that pipeline, which was almost entirely new to me, while
                    thinking critically about how each part affected the final product, and what I could do to eliminate
                    the bugs in the previous iteration.

                    <h2>4 Floors</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>
                    4 Floors was conceived as a way to adapt a side-scroller with RPG elements to a tabletop format. Some core goals of the game
                    were accessibility to non-gamers and cooperative multiplayer gameplay.
                    <br />
                    <br /> 4 Floors was developed in 3 weeks in 2016 with a team of 2 people: myself on systems design and my teammate
                    on art and graphic design.
                </p>
                <h3>Execution</h3>
                <p>
                    Because I was designing for tabletop, simplicity was a core guiding principle. The game had to be usable and the mechanics
                    learnable. Analogue games tend to be more successful with simpler and fewer rules (computers aren’t there
                    to walk players through the game and calculate all the different equations for them). Additionally, this
                    game was meant to be accessible to newer players or players who weren’t too interested in heavy calculations
                    and obscure rules.
                    <br />
                    <br /> In light of this, I had only a few rules- players started the game on the left side of the board, and
                    if they made it to the right side, then they won. Simple, right?
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img class="image general-image" src="images/projects/Iteration1.jpeg" >
                    <p class="image-caption">
                        First iteration of 4 Floors. The board setup afforded some fantastic design opportunities, but also created problems.

                <p>
                    Players would take on 2 columns of enemies at a time. Ranged units from the players’ party or the monsters’ party could attack
                    from the 2nd column, but melee units could only hit the column directly in front of them. By using skills
                    smartly it was possible to damage groups that you couldn't reach at the moment due to attacks that spanned
                    2 columns.
                    <br />
                    <br /> By making it to the last row players could fight and defeat a boss monster to win the game.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Dilemma</h3>
                <p>
                    Feedback indicated that our system for randomly generating columns (through dice rolls) was imbalanced, leading to unnecessarily
                    difficult situations. For example, it was very difficult to deal with a column of 5 units in front of
                    a column of 5 ranged units.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Another core piece of feedback was that there was not much variation in combat. There were 2, perhaps
                    3, types of enemies which acted similarly. People were interested in an expanded bestiary.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <h4>Enemy Group Size</h4>
                <p>
                    To deal with these issues, I decided to expand upon the narrative of the game and introduce new enemies. I had been inspired
                    by ‘A Pattern Language’ by Christopher Alexander, a book about how architecture and intentional design
                    can affect our everyday lives for the better, which got me thinking about how spaces in games can affect
                    gameplay. In this case, it led me to introduce a room based combat system.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img class="image general-image" src="images/projects/RoomExamples.jpg" >
                    <p class="image-caption">
                        Players now draw a random 'room' card from the 'room' deck. This will tell players how many monsters will be in the room,
                        as well as any additional effects or bonuses the room provides.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Room-based exploration was important in a few ways, the first being that a room’s size will limit the number of creatures
                    contained within it. Instead of every encounter having the possibility of a brutal number of enemies,
                    staging these encounters inside a limited space allowed me to dictate what range of enemies players would
                    face at a time. This was important for normalizing difficulty across all encounters. Finally, this change
                    also was helpful for learnability and usability of the system-- players could see only what they could
                    interact with at that moment.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img class="image general-image" src="images/projects/Iteration2.jpg" >
                    <p class="image-caption">
                        Using rooms helped to teach the game to players, as well as clearly define the difficulty curve of the game.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Combat Additions</h4>
                <p>
                    Players wanted different kinds of enemies, which required different approaches to combat for success. To address this pleasure
                    point I decided to include a more robust progression system, to give players more tools to work with,
                    as well as an increased variety in enemies, to facilitate the use of these tools.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img class="image general-image" src="images/projects/EnemyTypes.jpg" >
                    <p class="image-caption">
                        New, varied enemy types. Some deal damage per turn, some require being taken out from full HP in a single turn or they heal,
                        etc.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    New types of enemies were introduced which required different methods to overcome. This was tied into difficulty and progression
                    through use of a 'floor' system. Players would clear a certain number of rooms per floor, fight a boss,
                    then advance to the next floor. Later floors were more difficult and rewarding, allowing for me to design
                    obstacles for different stages of character progression. For simplicity, I designed all special monster
                    abilities to activate on rolls of 5 or 6. Sharing this across all enemy types help learnability and ease
                    of use.
                </p>
                <h4>Player Progression</h4>
                <p>
                    To deal with more powerful enemies and increase player engagement I updated character design with unique abilities and mechanics
                    per class. Every player would have 'skill cards' which allowed single use, powerful abilities to be activated.
                    Depending on which skill card was drawn players would have access to different abilities. This was done
                    to limit player options and to encourage spontaneous and explorative play.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">

                </div>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, I included items which helped to customize characters and shore up weaknesses or emphasize strengths
                    differently in each playthrough. Players would draw a random item from the item deck if certain conditions
                    were met, such as defeating a boss. Players could trade items to support cooperative play.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    By adding more content and refining existing mechanics, I shaped player options and increased both the depth and amount of
                    options available to players.

                    <br /> Personally, I feel the game successfully conveyed an interesting take on a cooperative side-scroller
                    experience while also containing dungeon crawling and RPG elements. I would love to revisit the horizontal
                    nature of initial iteration at some point, however, I feel that there were many problems, such as learnability
                    and clarity, that were improved with the move towards a room based system. It was definitely fun to design
                    a dungeon crawling tabletop RPG.

                    <h2>Strife!</h2>
                </header>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Strife! was my capstone project for my MA in Game Design at American University. We had 3 and a half months to create a project
                    from scratch, team size was a single person.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I’d been playing a lot of card games like Hearthstone and The Elder Scrolls: Legends at that point in my life, so I decided
                    to create a CCG-like game, however, I didn’t think the world needed another Magic clone(!), so I purposefully
                    made it mechanically distinct. Strife! is at heart an experimental mix of a board game and a CCG. I combined
                    the Strategy game and Card Game genres to create something new and exciting.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The main inspiration for Strife! came from the RTS and CCG genres. To start, I decided to map out a list of elements in both
                    of these genres, then try to find commonalities. From there I chose which of those elements were most
                    important, and which were less so.
                </p>

                <div class="image-wrapper">

                        <img class="image general-image rotated-image" src="images/strife/proto.jpeg" />
                    </a>
                    <p class="image-caption">

                </div>
                <p>
                    With a core direction defined, I could start brainstorming ways to mechanically represent them. I ended up focusing on a
                    spatial element of multiple ‘zones’. Additionally, I decided to reduce uncertainty by giving players
                    the ability to always have access to any units they’ve unlocked, throughout the game. This was meant
                    to also act as an homage to the tech trees in strategy games.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Finally, I created some units and abilities to populate the game and playtested. After each playtest I would use notes to
                    refine and adjust the balance of the game until it felt like a stable, dynamic, and exciting experience.

                        Getting to play with cards which had the stats and abilities printed on them was a milestone for me, and fantastic for people

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    To get a feel for the game, I’ll give an overview of the rules. Each player can construct buildings, these buildings can
                    spawn units. Buildings and units need one turn to get ready before they can be used. Units can use abilities,
                    attack, and move. Possible targets for offensive actions are other player’s buildings, units, and the
                    other player themselves. Destroying buildings is a way to damage your opponents economy. There’s also
                    a deck of powerful abilities which are obtained by producing structures.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img class="image general-image" src="images/strife/unionbuilding.PNG" >
                    <p class="image-caption">

                </div>

                <h3>Dilemmas</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout all phases of development, Strife! suffered from pacing issues. Many of the earlier iterations’ games would last
                    multiple hours with lulls where players wouldn’t meaningfully interact with each other. Finally, there
                    were huge issues with the amount of complexity present in both the rules of the game and the unit abilities.
                </p>

                <h3>Solutions for Pacing</h3>
                <p>
                    The mechanics of the game caused the slow pace of the game. Although I did like the core ideas of representing space via
                    multiple zones, as well as a tech tree players could progress on, their implementation left the game
                    feeling stale and unengaging. There were a large number of zones players had to progress through before
                    they could either damage a player’s health or economy, additionally, because moving used up that unit’s
                    actions for the turn, the defending player would always have the choice of what to trade for what. This
                    made defensive play incredibly strong.
                </p>
                <div class="image-wrapper">
                    <img class="image general-image portrait" src="images/strife/proto2.jpeg" >
                    <p class="image-caption">
                        An early playtest. Playing with index cards and spreadsheets did not help games to move quickly. Many times players would
                        spend minutes consulting the spreadsheet before taking their move.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Through playtesting, I settled upon using three zones, rather than 4, 6, or 8. Additionally, I allowed units to both use
                    an ability and move to a different zone each turn to allow for the aggressive player to choose what trades
                    they’d like to take. I also specified a cap of 6 units per zone, to stop players from stockpiling units,
                    creating an impenetrable wall of bodies. Finally, I linked board options to economic strength by way
                    of giving players a strong, randomized ability with every building constructed.

                <p>
                    In terms of economics, originally the game had ways to invest into economy, by building structures which boost gold gain
                    per turn. I wanted to allow players to play greedy and take risks for a greater payout later. However,
                    due to the defensive nature of the game, building these structures was always the correct move. I eventually
                    settled upon taking them out of the game, giving players a free structure each turn, and the ability
                    to build a second one for gold. This allowed players to invest in an immediate advantage, in the form
                    of units on the board, or an economic advantage, in the form of buildings.

                <h3>Solutions for Complexity</h3>
                <p>
                    For most of playtesting, users playtested with torn up index cards and spreadsheets off to the side. Many complained that
                    it was hard to understand which units could do what, and with tech trees being in the game, many didn’t
                    know what units they were progressing towards.

                        This is part of a larger tech tree sheet for the Union faction. By presenting this information in an easy to parse way, I
                        helped keep players engaged and increased the pace of the game for newer players.

                <p>
                    During the last two weeks of development, I spent my time looking at the pieces from a UX perspective. I did interviews to
                    figure out what kinds of things people wanted on cards, problems they faced, what they liked about the
                    game, etc. Using this information I created multiple mock-ups, focusing on both which information should
                    be included on the pieces, as well as how it’s included. I tested different icons, text, and shared terminology
                    to help users onboard quickly.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned a great deal by developing Strife! First off, one of the ideas I wanted to play around with was to do what I could
                    to remove randomness from the game. Doing so, in the way that I did, actually made the game static and
                    unengaging. By allowing for players to always be able to do any action, it takes away the developer’s
                    ability to make the actions exciting and powerful. The more situational and undependable a play is, the
                    more liberty we have, as designers, to make it strong and exciting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many other lessons, but ultimately, this was the most important to me. I feel like Strife! failed in many ways:
                    I had to reintroduce chance, and games take too long, however, I also
                    succeeded in making a unique, deep, and fun game. Because of this, and what I’ve learned from the project,
                    I consider the game a success.

                </header>

                <p>
                    I'm a coder, designer, and creative with a love for games and media. 
                    I spend my time creating new experiences and exploring what's already out there. I’ve been
                    playing games my whole life, and for the past 5~ years have pursued a career in creating them, finishing solo,
                    school, and professional projects with a multitude of responsibilities. I specialize systems design, ux design, and
                    programming in the C#, Python, C++, and Javascript languages.  I've contributed professionally as a 3D artist
                    and tools engineer as well.
                    <br />
                    <br /> I've been involved with esports since 2006, and I feel that this experience has helped to shape my view
                    of game design. As a competitive player in titles like Street Fighter, Dota, and Starcraft, I can understand
                    how, through my familiarity with their systems, mechanics affect the balance of a game on a deep level.
                    I feel that my familiarity with the competitive scene across many different titles has helped me to become
                    a better designer.
                    <br />
                    <br /> I was the deputy chair of the local IGDA chapter (DC) until I moved in the spring of 2018. During my
                    time in DC, I helped to run local game events (SAAM Arcade, GGJ, P3M5 @ the Goethe Institute). I'm currently
                    working as a Software Developer and Researcher for Educational Testing Services in San Francisco, a role which
                    I was hired into after completing my MA in Game Design (2018) at American University. 
                    My BA was obtained in Philosophy from SUNY Purchase in 2013.
                    <br />
                    <br />Cheers!
